# Tic-Tac-Toe
The Tic-Tac-Toe Unbeatable AI project leverages the Minimax algorithm to create a game where the artificial intelligence (AI) always plays optimally, ensuring it never loses. This project serves as an excellent demonstration of game theory, recursion, and algorithmic problem-solving in a practical context.
